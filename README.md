🛡️ What is FOHKASU?
-------------------
FOHKASU is not just a website blocker. It is a psychological intervention tool designed to interrupt addictive digital habits by targeting the emotional and cognitive loops that drive them.

Most blockers treat you like a machine ("Block Site X for 30 minutes."). FOHKASU treats you like a human with emotions, regrets, and a fading future. It uses dark psychology and visceral design to break the dopamine loop before it starts.

🧠 The Science Behind It
-----------------------
- Hyperbolic Discounting  
  We interrupt the immediate reward (e.g., TikTok) to force you to calculate the long-term cost — your future.

- Reward Prediction Error  
  By delaying the block for a few seconds, we create a "negative prediction error": the dopamine spike collapses into disappointment, weakening the learned reward.

- Memento Mori  
  FOHKASU calculates an estimate of how many weeks you have left and forces you to confront that number as a moment of reflection.

👁️ The Interface (Concept)
---------------------------
FOHKASU is designed to feel like high‑tech cognitive armor.

- The Dashboard  
  Your control center: profile, statistics, and the Graveyard (relapse history).

- The Void (Blocking Screen)  
  The immersive blocking experience: screen fades to black, targeted messages, audio cues, and the Memento Mori display.

Example blocking screen content:
- 🛡️ SYSTEM ACTIVE  
- Screen fades to black...  
- Identity: Asagi (Parent)  
- "If your child walked in right now, could you look them in the eye?"  
- The Graveyard (Last 28 Days)  
- 📉 Dopamine Crash Initiated  
- 💀 🛡️ 🛡️ 🛡️ 💀 🛡️ 🛡️  
- YOU HAVE 2,400 WEEKS LEFT TO LIVE.  
- 🛡️ 🛡️ 💀 🛡️ 🛡️ 🛡️ 🛡️  
- Don't waste this one.  
- (💀 = Relapse / 🛡️ = Focus)  
- (Audio: "Aria Math" plays softly)

✨ Key Features
---------------
- The Hallucination Protocol  
  Before blocking a site, FOHKASU rewrites page text (titles, headers) into unsettling messages that speak to the subconscious.

- The Graveyard of Time  
  A visual calendar that marks each day you relapse with a 💀. Watch your life rot in real time if you fail.

- Auditory Horror  
  Uses "Aria Math" (a haunting orchestral track) to trigger a Pavlovian response of focus and melancholy.

- Identity-Based Warfare  
  The extension adapts to your identity (Parent, Student, Male, Female, etc.) and tailors messages to maximize psychological impact.
  - Example prompts:
    - For Parents: "If your child walked in right now, could you look them in the eye?"
    - For Men: "You promised to build an empire. Look at you now."
