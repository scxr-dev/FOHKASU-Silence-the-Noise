# FOHKASU-Silence-the-Noise
We built FOHKASU because 'willpower' is a lie. The algorithms are smarter than us. They are designed by thousands of engineers to steal our time. A simple 'blocker' is like bringing a knife to a gunfight. We needed a weapon. We needed something that doesn't just stop the scroll, but kills the desire to scroll. We built FOHKASU to be that weapon
