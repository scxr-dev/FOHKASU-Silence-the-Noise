FOHKASU // 聚焦
A Cognitive Firewall for the Modern Mind.
"The screen is not hugging you back. You are holding a cold piece of glass."
🛡️ What is FOHKASU?
FOHKASU is not just a website blocker. It is a Psychological Intervention Tool.
Most blockers treat you like a machine: "Block Site X for 30 minutes."
FOHKASU treats you like a human with emotions, regrets, and a fading future. It uses Dark Psychology and Visceral Horror to break the dopamine loop before it starts.
🧠 The Science Behind It
Hyperbolic Discounting: We interrupt the immediate reward (TikTok) to force you to calculate the long-term cost (Your Future).
Reward Prediction Error: By delaying the block for 5 seconds, we create a "Negative Prediction Error" in your brain, making the dopamine spike collapse into disappointment.
Memento Mori: We calculate exactly how many weeks you have left to live and force you to look at that number.
👁️ The Interface (Concept)
We designed FOHKASU to feel like a piece of high-tech cognitive armor.

✨ Key Features
The Hallucination Protocol: Before blocking a site, FOHKASU rewrites the website's text (titles, headers) into nightmares that speak directly to your subconscious.
The Graveyard of Time: A visual calendar that marks every day you relapse with a 💀. Watch your life rot in real-time if you fail.
Auditory Horror: Uses "Aria Math" (a haunting orchestral track) to trigger a Pavlovian response of focus and melancholy.
Identity-Based Warfare: The extension learns who you are (Parent? Student? Male? Female?) and customizes the psychological attacks to hurt you specifically.
For Parents: "If your child walked in right now, could you look them in the eye?"
For Men: "You promised to build an empire. Look at you now."
